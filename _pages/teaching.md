I am just beginning to teach at the University of Southampton. For the 2022-2023 academic year, I am excited to be involved in SOES1009 The Living Earth as a guest lecturer and SOES6001 Contemporary Topics as a topic leader.

Previously, I have taught extensively as a teaching assistant at Stanford University, where I won the Centennial TA Award in 2021.
