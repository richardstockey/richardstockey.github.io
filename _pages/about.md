Hi, I am Richard Stockey. I am a Lecturer in Palaeobiology at the University of Southampton. 

My research primarily focuses on using numerical and statistical modelling approaches to better understand how environmental change has impacted marine ecosystems through Earth history. Much of my published research to date has focused upon how Earth's oceans became habitable for marine animals over the last billion years. More recently, I have also begun working to improve our understanding of the similarities and differences between more recent ancient warming events (over the last ~300 million years) and modern anthropogenic climate change.

This website is currently under continued construction. If you can't find the information you are looking for then please drop me an <a href="mailto:r.g.stockey@soton.ac.uk">email</a> and I would be very happy to chat!
